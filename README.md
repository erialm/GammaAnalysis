# GammaAnalysisi
Basic objective is to implement a gamma analysis tool using the geometric interpretation as described by Ju et al (2008) (https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1118/1.2836952)
Currently only 2D, but hopefully 3D will not take much longer. Unlike Ju's more sophisticated (and correct) variable search distance algorthim, this uses a fixed limited search algorithm.
